# Letter Grade
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:
  * Attach a "+" on their grade if the grade ends in a 7, 8 or 9 (eg: 78 -> C+, 89 -> B+)
  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)

   if the last substring is = to a 7 8 or 9 it will be a + else if it is a 0 1 or 2 it is a -. i will make it so that its like a puzzle and itll just add it on. 


2. Discuss how you would make sure 100 is not misrepresented as an A-.
  add at the very end of the code so that if it is a 100 it will have its own special output.


3. Discuss how you would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ (eg: 49 -> F+ and 52 -> F-)
  add at the very end of the code so that if it is a f it will have its own special output.
