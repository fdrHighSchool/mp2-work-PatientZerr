# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
   gets the everything starting from that number till the end 

  * `.substring(a, b)`
 takes everything from A to B

  * `.indexOf(str)`
   finds the index of that string

  * `.equals(str)`
  basically "=" but for strings 


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  if i is less than the length of s it will do something.
